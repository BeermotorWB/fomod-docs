# The fomod Documentation

*fomod* is game-agnostic format for mod installers, written in xml.

This documentation contains both the tutorial, for beginners,
with the most widely used options, and a collection of conventions
to make some specifics clearer for both *fomod* authors and installer
authors.

This documentation was written for the `5.x` major releases.
